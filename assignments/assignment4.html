      <h3>1. The Idea</h3>
      <p>
        Our project idea for a tinkering and scaffolding playground was inspired
        by Hexbugs. Hexbugs are little vibrating bodies of robots that are
        targeted as childrens' toys with which they can race and challenge them
        with obstacle courses. Our idea was to expand the concept of a Hexbug so
        that the the session attendees would be able to create their own
        vibrating robots with different materials for legs, weights and motors.
        Additionally the users would be provided control over the intensity of
        vibration through a knob that controls the motor power.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of our workshop is to teach and visualize students of physics
        and robotics how vibration can result in movement and how vibrational
        movement can be controlled with not only motor placement and intensity
        but also other materials used. The technical hurdle preventing the
        students from building these bots all by themselves is the fact that
        creating controllable sources of vibration takes a lot of effort on its
        own. To tackle this technical hurdle we provide the user a seed:
        multiple pre-connected DC motors with offset weights that are
        controllable with knobs, powered by a battery pack.

      <h3>2. Resource scavenging and tinkering</h3>
      <p>
        After we had a rough idea of what we needed to build to act as the seed,
        we started scavenging for materials and resources from the Design Lab
        and our own personal storages. At first we experimented with creating
        vibration with whatever parts we could find and be able to power. We
        experimented with fans, big and small as well as servo motors.
        Ultimately we ended up going with DC motors because of their simplicity
        and compact size.

      <p>
        Later we also got access to a basic Arduino kit with a DC motor, a
        battery and a battery connector alongside all other kinds of electrical
        components which helped a lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point in time we also 3D-printed our first iteration of the
        robot base, i.e. a plate on top of which all electrical and
        non-electrical components, legs etc. would be placed.

      <h3>3. Iteration #1</h3>
      <p>
        After deciding to work with DC motors, we took the below circuit as base
        and built it in the electrical workshop. It consisted of a battery, a DC
        motor and a knob for adjusting the intensity of the DC motor.
      </p>

        alt="Circuitry for the first prototype"
      />
      <p>
        After connecting and soldering the circuitry, we built our first
        iteration by simply attaching the electrical components with rubber
        bands on top of a plastic plate standing on popsicle sticks. To offset
        the weight of the DC motor we simply jammed an eraser through the axel
        of the motor. This worked out surprisingly well and the robot started
        moving according to the knob controls, breaking nothing.

      <h3>4. Iteration #2</h3>
      <p>
        After we had our first iteration of vibrating robot, we wanted to use
        our original 3D-printed plate that was supposed to act as the base of
        the robot and see if we had to make any changes to it. Also we wanted to
        attach another controllable DC motor into the mix to see if placing them
        any differently made a difference in the vibrational movement.

        Once again, nothing immediately broke although the weight stress caused
        by the second motor was notable. At this point building the bot felt
        more interactive as the we had more control over the leg materials and
        placement as well as the motor placements. The second iteration did
        require more power from the motors due its heavier weight.
