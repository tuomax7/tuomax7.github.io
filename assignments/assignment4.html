      <h3>1. Pitch #1: Our two tinkering session ideas</h3>
      <p>
        In the first pitch presentation for the group project we had to come up
        with two ideas for a tinkering session. We wanted to create something
        that had a technical seed that involved electronics but was also
        extendable with outside materials to allow for true tinkering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first idea was a session in which we give the participants a
        vibration motor and they use that, combined with household materials to
        create vibrational art. A major source of inspiration for us was the
        concept of a Scribblebot that has pencils for legs and vibrates its way
        around a paper, thus creating art. Below is the mood board for this idea
        from our pitch presentation, visualizing the opportunities of such
        tinkering.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/vibrabot0_0.png" alt="Vibration art" />

      <p>
        The second idea was about expressing emotions and experiences as well as
        telling stories through both electrically controlled lighting and sounds
        as well as physical minigures and everyday objects. The goal was to help
        participants express usually so abstract emotions and experiences in a
        physical, tinkerable way. Below is the mood board for this from our
        presentation.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/vibrabot0_1.png" alt="Planning overview" />

      <p>
        During the pitch presentation multiple people (including ourselves)
        questioned whether the second idea involving expressing emotions was too
        abstract and not actionable enough. It was easy to see that people might
        have trouble getting started with the kit unless they have an emotion or
        a story well-defined in their mind already, which is often not the case.
        The first idea, on the other hand, was much more concrete and
        approachable, as well as technically well-defined so we choose to focus
        on that.
      </p>

      <p>
        After trying to think deeper into what kind of vibrational art can be
        created and what would the goal of the tinkering participant be in that
        scenario, we ultimately felt that just producing art was not actionable
        and inspiring enough for the session. Since we liked the idea of
        vibrational movement anyway, we shifted to a much more concrete and
        measurable tinkering outcome: vibrating robots that attempt to complete
        a race track as smoothly and quickly as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Pitch #2: Vibrating race robots</h3>
      <p>
        In the second pitch we had to refine our idea and explain it in a bit
        more detail. Here's how we started exploring the idea further.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our selected project idea for a tinkering and scaffolding playground
        involving vibrating robots was inspired by Hexbugs (<em
          >Spin Master, 2023</em
        >). Hexbugs are little vibrating bodies of robots that are targeted as
        childrens' toys with which they can race and challenge them with
        obstacle courses. Our idea was to expand the concept of a Hexbug so that
        the the session attendees would be able to create their own vibrating
        robots with different materials for legs, weights and motors.
        Additionally the users would be provided control over the intensity of
        vibration through a knob that controls the motor power.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of our workshop is to teach and visualize students of physics
        and robotics how vibration can result in movement and how vibrational
        movement can be controlled with not only motor placement and intensity
        but also other materials used. The technical hurdle preventing the
        students from building these bots all by themselves is the fact that
        creating controllable sources of vibration takes a lot of effort on its
        own. To tackle this technical hurdle we provide the user a seed:
        multiple pre-connected DC motors with offset weights that are
        controllable with knobs, powered by a battery pack.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/vibrabot1.png" alt="Planning overview" />

      <p>
        The feedback we got at the second pitch session was better. No one was
        questioning whether our idea was approachable enough or technically
        feasible. This gave us confidence. However, some questions arose from
        whether the robot would be extendible enough and what would be the
        element of surprise during tinkering. Apparently it was not clear that
        the motors would be controllable, leg materials freely constructable and
        the race track built by the participants themselves. Due to this
        misunderstanding we wanted to make sure that in the actual session we
        would communicate clearly enough that the participant is free to alter
        any of these things and control the robot motor intensities freely
        during testing.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Resource scavenging and tinkering</h3>
      <p>
        After we had a rough idea of what we needed to build to act as the seed,
        we started scavenging for materials and resources from the Design Lab
        and our own personal storages. At first we experimented with creating
        vibration with whatever parts we could find and be able to power. We
        experimented with fans, big and small as well as servo motors.
        Ultimately we ended up going with DC motors because of their simplicity
        and compact size.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/vibrabot2.jpeg" alt="Resource scavenging" />
      <p>
        Later we also got access to a basic Arduino kit with a DC motor, a
        battery and a battery connector alongside all other kinds of electrical
        components which helped a lot.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/vibrabot3.jpg" alt="Arduino kit" />
      <p>
        At this point in time we also 3D-printed our first iteration of the
        robot base, i.e. a plate on top of which all electrical and
        non-electrical components, legs etc. would be placed.
      </p>

        alt="3D printing schema for the base plate"
      />
      <img src="../images/vibrabot5.jpeg" alt="3D printing in progress" />

      <h3>4. Iteration #1</h3>
      <p>
        After deciding to work with DC motors, we took the below circuit as base
        (<em>Stuff Builder, 2016</em>) and built it in the electrical workshop.
        It consisted of a battery, a DC motor and a knob for adjusting the
        intensity of the DC motor.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/vibrabot6.jpeg"
        alt="Circuitry for the first prototype"
      />
      <p>
        After connecting and soldering the circuitry, we built our first
        iteration by simply attaching the electrical components with rubber
        bands on top of a plastic plate standing on popsicle sticks. To offset
        the weight of the DC motor we simply jammed an eraser through the axel
        of the motor. This worked out surprisingly well and the robot started
        moving according to the knob controls, breaking nothing.

      <h3>5. Iteration #2</h3>
      <p>
        After we had our first iteration of vibrating robot, we wanted to use
        our original 3D-printed plate that was supposed to act as the base of
        the robot and see if we had to make any changes to it. Also we wanted to
        attach another controllable DC motor into the mix to see if placing them
        any differently made a difference in the vibrational movement.

      <p>
        Once again, nothing immediately broke although the weight stress caused
        by the second motor was notable. At this point building the bot felt
        more interactive as the we had more control over the leg materials and
        placement as well as the motor placements. The second iteration did
        require more power from the motors due its heavier weight.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Seed improvement: new base plate, magnets, soldering</h3>
      <p>
        At this point we were confident enough in our seed iteration to create
        the final version of the seed. We thus 3D-printed a new version of the
        base plate, this time a bit bigger an with holes for adding magnets. We
        wanted to add magnets to the sliding pieces of the base plate to make
        them actually stick since we noticed that when the robot vibrates the
        pieces can easily slide off. After printing the base plate and the
        pieces, we simply glued them in.
      </p>

      <img src="../images/vibrabot9.png" alt="New base plate with magnets" />

      <p>
        After we had our new base plate ready, we wanted to finalize the seed
        electronics circuit next. This meant soldering the connections and
        heat-tubing them so that there were not exposed wires. We left some
        connections unsoldered so that they could be plugged in-and-out easily.
        This was a good choice since it allowed us to organize the wires much
        easier. We also hotglued the battery holder and mosfets to the base and
        the motors and the potentiometers to slidable pieces.
      </p>

      <img src="../images/vibrabot10.png" alt="Soldered seed" />

      <h3>7. User testing session</h3>
      <p>
        With the newest version of our seed and a clearer idea of the session
        flow in mind we conducted a user testing session in which we presented
        our sessions to each other, observed their work and asked for feedback.
      </p>

      <p>
        The test participants quickly got to tinkering with the seed, first
        trying out controlling the vibration motors and then moving on to
        construct the legs. The one major thing we helped them with while
        building the bot was how to produce vibrational movement with the DC
        motors. The key was to attach an off-center weight such as a rubber
        eraser to the motor heads.
      </p>

      <img
        src="../images/vibrabot11.jpeg"
        alt="User testing session building"
      />

      <p>
        Ultimately the group managed to create a robot that moved independently
        through vibration along a race track they themselves constructed.
        Controlling the movement direction of the robot proved very difficult
        but it was tinkerable still since the leg materials were easily
        modifiable and tinkering with the weight distribution of the robot made
        a clear difference.
      </p>

      <img
        src="../images/vibrabot12.jpeg"
        alt="User testing session final result"
      />

      <p>
        The feedback we received was mostly positive and the test participants
        reported that they did get inspired building the robot and felt that
        they succeeded in their task. However, they also said that the beginning
        of the session was a bit chaotic due to unclear objectives, available
        materials and the overall flow of the session.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was really important that we conducted this test session also since
        we realized at that point that we were winging parts of the session a
        bit too nonchalantly. Afterwards we created the following Tinker Bots
        Workshop pdf that was intended to act as a guide for the facilitator.

      <h3>8. Final demo session</h3>
      <p>
        Finally it was time for the final demo session / market. Before that we
        still wanted to tidy up the messy wires with electrical tape and
        organize the scaffolding materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started off with a quick 1-minute pitch of our idea, provided by
        Gabriel and Daniel.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/vibrabot13.png"
        alt="User testing session final result"
      />
      <p>
        And then it was time to tinker! We had multiple people come over to our
        stand and all of the managed to work the motors and add legs. The one
        thing no one was able to figure out by themselves without our help was
        how to produce the vibrational movement after powering the motors.
        However, after we explained the concept of an off-center weight to them,
        they quickly understood the gist of it and managed to get their robot
        vibrating properly. Throughout the session we saw many different types
        of robots being built, which was a success to see since it meant that
        the participants had actual freedom in their implementation.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        The robot of one participant even almost managed to complete a track
        with a turn successfully, just barely getting stuck in the end!

      <h3>9. Final reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Overall our tinkering session project was a success since it provided
        participants with interesting hands-on experiences palying around with
        the materials. The goal of the workshop was defined well-enough and the
        seed was easy for the participants to operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this whole project was a very rough prototype of a concept such
        as this and would need much more refinement and clarification for it to
        be ready for actual teaching use. The session structure was somewhat
        chaotic and I feel like there are more ways of tackling vibrational
        movement that we did not have time to look into for the purposes of this
        course.
