      <h2>Assignment: 2. 3D Prototyping Building Blocks</h2>
      <p><strong>By: </strong>Tuomas Nummela</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In this assignment, we were tasked with designing and creating a 3D
        prototype based on our previous conceptual design work for creating a
        custom building block. The objective was to produce something tangible
        that can be used for physical prototyping.

        <h3>Tinkering process</h3>

        <h4>Phase 1: Gathering materials in the DesignLab</h4>
        <p>
          Gathering different kinds of possible materials for the node blocks
          and the connecting sticks and tools for tinkering with them. Some
          required features recognised in the previous assignment were:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The node blocks must accept connector edges from all kinds of angles
            and allow for quick connecting and disconnecting of edges
          </li>
          <li>
            The node blocks would ideally be colored and the edges labeled
            according to weight
          </li>
          <li>
            The overall structure has to be structurally strong enought to
            support building elaborate 3D graphs
          </li>
        </ol>

        />

        <h4>Phase 2: Selecting the materials for edges</h4>
        <p>
          For the edges connecting the node blocks I sharpened the points of
          different kinds of wooden sticks I found in the Design Lab. I ended up
          going with the centermost stick since it was the lightest to use and
          easiest to stick into different kinds of node block candidates. The
          other two would have offered more surface for possible edge labeling
          but I did not prioritize that over good connectivity.
        </p>

        />

        <h4>Phase 3: Trying out different materials for the node blocks</h4>
        <p>
          Now that I had selected the material used for the edges, it was time
          to try out different materials for the node blocks. Initially I was
          most enthusiastic about these foam cutouts that were light and allowed
          easy connectivity to sharpened wooden sticks. Additionally the foam
          seemed to reconstruct any holes made after disconnecting an edge.
        </p>

        />

        <h4>Phase 4: Choosing a material for the node blocks</h4>
        <p>
          However, after building some 3D structures with the foam blocks they
          turned out too smushy to work with which caused the structures to
          collapse easily. I then turned to these styrofoam-type pellets that
          allowed easy puncturing with the sticks while still being solid enough
          to retain structural integrity. In addition they were pre-colored
          which was perfect for the idea of using the blocks for teaching graph
          colorings.

        <h4>
          Phase 5: Verifying the structural strength of the materials selected
        </h4>
        <p>
          After selecting materials for both the node blocks as well as the
          edges connecting them, it was time to play around with them a bit more
          to verify that the structures built using them do not fall apart. The
          only issue I found was that the styrofoam node blocks do get damaged
          irreversibly when the edges puncture them. This means that the node
          blocks used have to be replaced from time to time with new ones.
          Luckily they do not cost that much and are even be available for
          anyone to buy themselves too.

        />

        <h4>Phase 6: Labeling the edges</h4>
        <p>
          I thought about different ways of introducing weighted edges into the
          building kit. The edges themselves are too thin to write anything on,
          but one solution could be to add stickable or threadable labels,
          depicted by the tape in the prototype. Labels on edges combined with
          colored nodes could be used for creating builds such as the one below.
          The user could then be asked e.g. what is the shortest path from the
          red node to the yellow node which the user could answer by inspecting
          the 3D structure hands-on.
        </p>

        <h4>Phase 7: Summarizing the kit elements</h4>
        <p>
          Altogether the graph building block kit would thus consist of
          differently colored sets of styrofoam nodes, wooden sticks as the
          connecting edges and attachable edge weight labels depicted by
          numbers.

      <h3>Interoperability</h3>
      <p>
        In order to interface the graph building kit with other materials and
        construction kits, I see two main approaches:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          An interface piece that is an edge, i.e. one end is a stick that can
          be connected to a node and the other is any kind of other building kit
          piece
        </li>
        <li>
          An interface piece that is partly a styrofoam node and partly any
          other type of building kit piece
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Out of these two options the edge-interface piece seems more feasible
        and structurally stable to conscruct since it seems much more difficult
        to attach anything into styrofoam compared to a wooden stick. Below are
        some sketches I made for possible interface-edges, drawing inspiration
        from the
