      <h2>Project Title: Designing a Construction Block</h2>
      <p><strong>Created by: </strong>Tuomas Nummela</p>
      <p><strong>Date: </strong> February 11, 2025</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        This assignment explores the concept of a construction/building block
        through the design of a new material or block. Using LEGO as an example,
        which is known for its versatility in tinkering and creative
        applications, the task is to come up with an innovative building block
        idea.
      </p>

      <h3>Design Concept</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to create a new building block that can
        address a specific technical challenge. For instance, designing a block
        that can interlock in multiple ways or one that adapts to different
        environments (e.g., building in tight spaces, creating lightweight
        structures).
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Hurdle Tackled</h3>
      <p>
        The specific challenge that this design addresses is the difficulty of
        constructing stable structures in constrained or irregular spaces. The
        block I propose allows for easy interlocking at different angles,
        enabling flexibility in design while maintaining structural integrity in
        non-standard configurations.
      </p>

      <h3>Concept Drawings</h3>
      <p>
        Below, you will find a series of 10 concept sketches showing the
        progression of my building block design. These sketches highlight
        various iterations and refinements, leading to the final concept.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        This process of designing a new building block was challenging but
        rewarding. The ability to address a specific technical problem, while
        also exploring new possibilities for construction materials, allowed for
        a great deal of creativity and innovation. The progression of sketches
        shows how the block evolved to meet the functional requirements while
        maintaining usability.
