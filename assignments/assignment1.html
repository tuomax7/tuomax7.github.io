      <h2>Assignment: 1. Building Blocks</h2>
      <p><strong>By: </strong>Tuomas Nummela</p>
      <p><strong>Date: </strong> 23/02/2025</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In this assignment we were asked to design a rough concept of our own
        construction / building block akin to LEGO blocks. We had to provide 10
        sketches or morphological constructions to showcase our tinkering
        progression.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h4>Concept Iterations</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 1:</strong> Random sketching of what comes to mind
          when thinking of building blocks in a simplified 2D-space.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 2:</strong> It becomes clear that some kind of
          planned exploration of different possibilities is required. I thus
          divided a rectangle into four sections and attempted to partition each
          of them in a unique way but still using a limited set of different
          types of pieces. The upper left section consists of uniform squares,
          the upper right of L-blocks of two different dimensions, the lower
          left of L-blocks of the same dimensions the lower right consists of
          2x2 squares and uniform L-blocks combined.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 3:</strong> I still feel very limited in my thinking
          so I instead look into different interlocking mechanisms and come up
          with chained blocks, regular puzzle pieces (3D puzzle pieces come to
          mind). Ultimately I feel the most enthusiastic with the possibilities
          of simple dots connected by lines. That idea is also the easiest to
          tinker with using my current workspace materials so I choose to
          explore it further.
        </p>

          alt="Iteration 3: Concept exploration of various interlocking methods"
        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 4:</strong> I finally get around to tinkering with
          my hands and as a very first prototype connect some of the wool blocks
          (that are very easy to puncture for creating connections between
          blocks) with some pens I have on hand.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 5:</strong> Feeling more and more enthusiastic about
          the concept, I cut uniform sticks out of cardboard to replace the pens
          and manage to create a 3D structure out of my prototype building
          blocks. I also realize that having just the right amount of elasticity
          (bending) on the connecting bridges makes for a more fun and smooth
          building experience.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 6:</strong> Tinkering with my prototype building
          blocks reminds of constructing graphs and I come up with the idea of
          using these kinds of building blocks to visualize and teach graph
          theory in a fun way. Thus, drawing from the concepts of graph theory,
          I label some of the connecting edges with numbers to depict weighted
          edges.
        </p>

          src="../images/iteration_6.png"
          alt="Iteration 6: Prototype with weighted edges inspired by graph theory"
        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 7:</strong> Diving deeper into graph theory I also
          think about providing different colors for the node blocks to allow
          users to experiment with graph coloring algorithms.
        </p>

          src="../images/iteration_7.png"
          alt="Iteration 7: Introduction of color-coded node blocks"
        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 8:</strong> Also from graph theory, I include
          directed edges into the mix. At this point I get concerned that
          including all of these things simultaneously might make the building
          blocks a bit too complex to work with. Thus in the final product set
          some edges and node blocks should probably be left completely unmarked
          for balance.
        </p>

          alt="Iteration 8: Testing directed edges in block connections"
        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 9:</strong> With all of these ideas I go back to
          sketching with a clearer vision. I map out examples of use cases for
          these types of blocks: 3D-structures for fun, creating simple network
          graphs, and depicting family trees. Additionally I list examples of
          different node block colors and edge types.
        </p>

        />

        <p>
          <strong>Iteration 10:</strong> I combine all of the different edge and
          node block ideas together in a 3D-structure to see how complex having
          all of them together would feel. Building the structure feels a bit
          overwhelming with so much going on and everything labeled. I am now
          reassured that the final product set of node blocks and edges needs to
          consist of both simple unmarked elements as well as marked elements so
          that the user themselves can control the complexity. Also building and
          interpreting instructions for some common graphs could be included.
          This could even be gamified if the user were to first build the graph
          and then they were quizzed on various graph properties that they would
          then answer based on inspecting their creation.
        </p>

      <h3>Technical Hurdles Tackled</h3>
      <p>
        When sketching and prototyping this type of building blocks I came
        across the following technical hurdles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Node block has to accept any amount of connections from all
            directions</strong
          >: in order to not limit the type of graphs the user can construct,
          the node blocks have to be designed to accept multiple edges from any
          threedimensional direction. Moreover, the blocks also have to be
          reusable for other types of edge connections later. So simply sticking
          holes into a node block for any new edge is not a suistanable design
          solution unless the holes fill upon edge removal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Balancing complexity</strong>: Adding more elements and
          characteristics to the blocks makes the building experience more rich
          and thus possily more fun but it might also confuse them about how to
          start building. Moreover, multiple colorings and labels combined will
          be more difficult to apply simultaneously on building elements so that
          all of their characterics are legible and interpretable
          simultaneously.
