      <h2>Assignment: 3. Scaffolding Metaphor for Coding</h2>
      <p><strong>By: </strong>Tuomas Nummela</p>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In this project we were tasked with designing a scaffolding material
        that acts as a metaphor for programming. One of my first ideas was
        something that would allow users to tinker with different data structure
        formats and learn the syntax more interactively than by working on a
        computer, or worse, by simply reading the syntax and trying to memorize
        parts of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to focus on depicting the JSON syntax since it is very common
        and not too complicated to grasp through some studying. The first
        hands-on idea I got was to represent different parts of JSON syntax,
        such as field names, different value types and nested arrays and objects
        throught puzzle pieces made from cardboard. The pieces would then only
        connect in a way that stays true to the syntax. The two main objectives
        of the puzzle are to show that even the same data can be organized in
        many different structures and to also teach JSON syntax.
      </p>

        <h3>Design process</h3>

        <h4>Iteration 1: Looking at a JSON example</h4>
        <p>
          To start, I examined some basic JSON data and identified key elements
          such as field names, string values, number values, booleans, arrays
          and nested objects.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/json-iteration-0.png"
          alt="Iteration 1: Example of JSON"
        />

        <h4>Iteration 2: Cardboard sketching</h4>
        <p>
          Next I wrote some very basic JSON on a piece of cardboard with a
          marker and started drawing the outline for how that JSON could be
          divided into blocks. Notice that the field names connect to the root
          brackets differently than the values connect to the field names. This
          is to prevent the user from creating incorrect JSON by attaching
          values directly to the root brackets.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/json-iteration-1.png"
          alt="Iteration 2: Cardboard Sketching"
        />

        <h4>Iteration 3: Cut-out pieces of JSON syntax</h4>
        <p>
          Next I cut out the pieces using scissors. In hindsight using an x-acto
          knife would have produced much more consistent pieces.
        </p>

          src="../images/json-iteration-2.png"
          alt="Iteration 3: Cut-Out Pieces of JSON Syntax"
        />

        <h4>Iteration 4: Playing around with the pieces</h4>
        <p>
          At this point I explored with the basic prototype different ways the
          pieces could be arranged to form different JSON objects and thought
          about what other kinds of JSON syntax pieces I should add.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/json-iteration-3.png"
          alt="Iteration 4: Playing around with the pieces"
        />

        <h4>Iteration 5: More syntax pieces</h4>
        <p>
          Introduced additional elements such as nested object brackets,
          booleans, and null values to expand the complexity of possible JSON
          structures. At this point I designed and cut out new pieces,
          introducing boolean and null values and nested objects into the mix.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/json-iteration-4.png"
          alt="Iteration 5: More JSON Syntax Pieces"
        />

        <h4>Iteration 6: Playing around with the pieces (again)</h4>
        <p>
          Once again, I played around with the pieces and thought of how to make
          the experience more visual and fun. At this point I also struggled
          with connecting the pieces as they were much too different sizes and
          not cut uniformly. Using scissors was not a good choice.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../images/json-iteration-5.png"
          alt="Iteration 6: Playing around with the pieces (again)"
        />

        <h4>Iteration 7: Color coding for piece types</h4>
        <p>
          At this point I feel like I had enough of different types of pieces
          and shifted to work on the visual appeal of them. I thus grouped and
          color-coded the pieces using sharpies of different colors according to the piece type:
		  <ul>
			<li>Field name: <span style="color: purple;">purple</span></li>
			<li>String value: <span style="color: orange;">orange</span></li>
			<li>Number value: <span style="color: blue;">blue</span></li>
			<li>Null value: <span style="color: red;">red</span></li>
			<li>Boolean value: <span style="color: yellow;">yellow</span></li>
			<li>Array brackets: <span style="color: darkgreen;">dark green</span></li>
			<li>Object brackets: <span style="color: lightgreen;">light green</span></li>
		  </ul>
        </p>
