      <h2>Inspecting Tinkering Critically</h2>
      <p>
        In this post I will do some critical reflecting on the limitations and
        possible side effects of tinkering through a series of reflective
        questions.

          <h3>
            Tinkering is a way to generate knowledge. What kind of knowledge
            results from a tinkering process in your experience?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The knowledge generated through tinkering is often mostly
            experiences, feelings and observations about how applying specific
            changes to a system affects it. This kind of knowledge has a very
            low level of abstraction and is bound to the tinkering environment.
            The learned knowledge will not automatically translate into any
            bigger picture realization or universal experience, though tinkering
            can act as a launchpad for wider reflecting.

            Tinkering with classical materials like clay, paper, colour,
            textiles is more related to craft. How does tinkering work with
            digital and electronic media?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The nature of tinkering itself is not limited to hands-on, physical
            materials. Iteratively experimenting and adjusting digital
            properties and characteristics of e.g. video, music or software can
            be considered tinkering just as well. However, it can be argued that
            tinkering with hands-on materials is more interactive and thus more
            thought-evoking and effective.

          <h3>
            One basic characteristic of science is reproducibility. Is that
            possible with tinkering? Or do we want that at all?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Tinkering supports reproducibility to some extent. When given
            materials, tools, scaffolding and an objective, we can affect the
            tinkering process, experience and results of different individuals.
            However, one of the main goals of tinkering is a certain unknowness
            of these things. If we aim for complete reproducibility we lose
            that. But that is not to say that tinkering processes would be
            simply random, non-reproducible experiences.

            Design practice changed during the past years, from long design
            phases to short, iterative processes, due to the availability of new
            prototyping technologies. Is this iterative process of prototyping
            qualitatively different from the cycles we do in tinkering?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Iterative design shares similarities with tinkering, since both of
            them focus on short term innovation, allow and encourage making
            mistakes and design-wise suboptimal decisions and focus on gradually
            improving/creating a product. The key difference between iterative
            design and tinkering is that tinkering does not require a specific
            goal in mind, whereas successful iterative design requires clearly
            defined objectives and quality metrics so that the designers know
            when is the right time to stop iterating.

          <h3>
            Can a co-design session be described as a tinkering session as we
            treat it in our course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Co-operative design refers to a design process which involves not
            only designers but also other stakeholders such as users and project
            managers. While tinkering aims to involve all participants of the
            session in the creation process in a similar way, the process is
            still different from a traditional design process. However,
            co-design sessions are one step closer to tinkering sessions since
            they emphasize involving everyday people to interact and participate
            in the design process.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="reflection-topic">
          <h3>
            The choice of materials (seed, tools, scaffolding, facilitation) has
            an effect on the outcome, the knowledge and products made in a
            tinkering session. How can we use that in a co-design session? Can
            we really influence the kind of results here, and do we want that?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Similar to setting up a tinkering playground setting with
            scaffolding materials and instructions, we can create a co-design
            setting that gives the participants ideas while steering them
            towards viable and actionable design solutions. Without the proper
            limitations and guidance both tinkering and co-design sessions turn
            into chaos which ultimately produces nothing of value. That is why
            we do want to pose some limitations materialwise to ensure
            meaningful sessions and end results.

          <h3>
            In “research through design” can tinkering fill in the design part?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Research through design refers to conducting scientific research
            through doing hands-on design work and learning from it. Research
            through design is especially effective for researching two main
            things: design itself, and the behavior of people. This is because
            any research method that does not involve hands-on design work does
            not allow us to observe and learn from the design process and the
            people involved themselves. In that sense “research through
            tinkering” would be about researching 1) the tinkering process and
            2) the behavior of people. Thus while tinkering and design processes
            are different, through both one can still research human behavior in
            those types of situations.

          <h3>
            Are there design questions where tinkering is not a possible or
            useful approach?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Tinkering requires a certain level of hands-on exploration for it to
            be effective. When we are designing very high-level abstract things
            such as user experience or organization culture tinkering can even
            become impossible.

            Read Invent to Learn (2013) page 41. How to balance real-world
            (criticality) with the fruitful mindset of tinkering?
          </h3>
          <p>
            (I have the 2019 edition of Invent To Learn so I do not know what
            section of the book that refers to). In a general sense real-world
            criticality and its limitations actually support creative processes.
            This is because uncontrolled and -limited creation and tinkering
            only results in chaos and/or meaningless results since the end
            products are not physically realistic, scalable or actionable in any
            other sense. Thus tinkering facilitators should not be afraid of
            setting limitations and offering controlled guidance. However, the
            important thing is that they must be aware of and recognize when
            they pose limitations or offer guidance since that can also happen
            unintentionally and in a harmful way to the creative process.

            What is the critical impact your tinkering exercise could have? (on

            negative)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our group project tinkering session is about building vibrating race
            robots. The scaffolding problem we are tacking is that we want to
            visualize and teach vibrational movement without the participants
            requiring to know anything about the electronics powering the
            vibration. A positive critical impact the session could have is that
            the participants also become interested in how the electronics work
            in the process. A possible negative impact is that they lose
            interest in the vibrational movement altogether, if the electronics
            or the scaffolding material we provide them are still too complex to
            use and work with.

            What is the impact your session has regarding (more) stuff,
            ecological footprint and impact on our planet (i.e. how can you
            avoid that STEM workshops with waste material result in more waste
            material?)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Our vibrating race robots session is not tied to any other materials
            apart from the electronics of the seed we provide them. All other
            materials and tools can be chosen in an environmentally friendly way
            and recycled afterwards. The most environmentally negative impact
            our session has is that it is battery powered. We use a 9 volt
            battery to power two DC motors. This means that the battery runs out
            in approximately two sessions and it then has to be replaced. For
            this we should have a battery recharger in hand and make sure that
            the participants do not leave the motors on by accident or too long.

      <h2>Reflecting on Tinkering and Facilitation</h2>
      <p>
        This section explores facilitation, learning , and my personal tinkering
        in design and engineering processes.

          <h3>Facilitation Approaches for Adults</h3>
          <p>
            The LEGO Serious Play guide defines facilitation as “making
            something (difficult) easier.” In LEGO Serious Play, the role of a
            facilitator is to drive the facilitated process by helping people
            explore, learn, and develop. The two most important things to keep
            in mind as a facilitator are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Focus on open-ended building challenges and allowing room for
              questions, reflections, and dialogue.
            </li>
            <li>
              Utilizing the physical LEGO bricks fully as facilitation tools,
              encouraging hands-on engagement in any way imaginable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When it comes to adults, it might be more difficult to get them to
            engage with LEGOs or other toy-like facilitation tools. They might
            find the concept humorous and struggle to fully engage in the
            process. The perceived silliness, paired with a fear of making
            mistakes with children’s toys, could make people more passive and
            restrict innovation and discussion.

          <h4>Papert’s Constructionist Learning Principles</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Learn by doing instead of observing.</li>
            <li>Building with technology can elevate learning.</li>
            <li>Learning should be fun but not too easy.</li>
            <li>Take charge of your personal learning.</li>
            <li>Manage your personal time yourself.</li>

          </ol>

          <h4>Montessori’s Learning Principles</h4>

          <p>
            Italian doctor of pedagogy Maria Montessori also developed ten
            principles based on respect for children’s learning process:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Respect children; their uniqueness and freedom.</li>
            <li>
              Children absorb information best during their first 6 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              Children show sensitive periods when they learn better than at
              other times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Children should learn wholly—intellectually, physically,
              emotionally, and socially.
            </li>
            <li>Learning should be individualized.</li>
            <li>
              Children should not be constrained and should be free to move and
              interact.
            </li>
            <li>
              Places of learning should be prepared and thoughtfully designed.
            </li>
            <li>Learning should be intrinsically motivating.</li>
            <li>Independence should guide children's learning.</li>
            <li>
              Trust in children learning by themselves when provided stimuli.

          <h3>Designing Effective Tinkering Spaces</h3>
          <p>
            Chapter 11 of ‘Invent to learn’ describes shaping learning and
            tinkering environments successfully:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designing a space that is both functional and flexible.</li>
            <li>Prioritizing security and safety.</li>
            <li>Ensuring enough project storage.</li>
            <li>
              Setting rules and protocols on how parts and tools are shared or
              distributed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Providing flexible accessibility instead of rigid operating hours.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A design lab does not necessarily need the latest tools or abundant
            materials. Instead, it should be an accessible, safe, and inspiring
            space with some stimuli for creation.
          </p>

      <h3>My Tinkering Practices as an Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        I most naturally do tinkering in the middle phases of development or
        design. This is when I have already spent some time on the first
        iteration. At that point, I am confident enough with the state of the
        product to assess whether there is potential in it or not. Tinkering
        with too many ideas too early is difficult for me because I feel like
        many of my better improvement ideas stem after I have focused on a
        limited scope for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One natural way for me to get unstuck in engineering/design problems is
        to get out of my head by either drawing notes of what I am currently
        thinking (thought-dumping) or by taking a piece of paper and trying to
        draw the ideas I am thinking of. I feel like this gives me more space to
        think and helps me get back to my flow process as I do not have to
        juggle the previous ideas in my head anymore.

      <h2>Initial Reflection on Tinkering</h2>
      <p>
        This post contains some of my initial reflectioning and thoughts about
        tinkering before the course has properly kicked off.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Defining Tinkering, Trial-and-Error, and Brainstorming</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Tinkering:</strong> "To work in the manner of a tinker.
        Especially: to repair, adjust, or work with something in an unskilled or
        experimental manner." (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>) | "Engaging in hands-on
        experimentation with an object, system, or idea, often without a fixed
        goal, to explore possibilities, make adjustments, or improve
        functionality." (<em>Chat-GPT</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trial-and-Error:</strong> "Finding out the best way to reach a
        desired result or a correct solution by trying out one or more ways or
        means and by noting and eliminating errors or causes of failure."
        (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>) | "A method of problem-solving that involves
        testing different approaches, learning from failures, and refining the
        solution through iteration." (<em>Chat-GPT</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Brainstorming:</strong> "A group problem-solving technique that
        involves the spontaneous contribution of ideas from all members of the
        group." (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>) | "A creative process where
        individuals or groups generate and refine ideas through free-flowing,
        spontaneous discussion without immediate judgment." (<em>Chat-GPT</em>)
      </p>
      <br />

      <strong
        >Definition of a 'tinkering mindset' by the course materials:</strong
      >
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a required open-endedness (considering a solution space or
          result).
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a notion of iteration (trial and error, incremental
          improvements and changes).
        </li>
        <li>The process and mindset are active, hands-on, and experimental.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Comparison:</strong> The Merriam-Webster definitions emphasize
        the traditional and structured meanings of these concepts, while
        Chat-GPT's definitions focus on their practical and exploratory aspects.
        The course's "tinkering mindset" aligns closely with both but emphasizes
        open-ended exploration, iteration, and hands-on experimentation.
        Tinkering overlaps with trial-and-error but is more creative, and
        brainstorming shares elements of spontaneity but lacks the hands-on
        aspect of tinkering.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Technical Hurdles in an I-Tech Project</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A typical I-Tech Related Project Case: Smart Clothing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart clothing combines fashion and technology, often integrating
        sensors and electronics into fabric to monitor health, track movement,
        or improve comfort.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. Power Supply and Battery Life:</strong><br />
          One of the biggest challenges in smart clothing is integrating a power
          supply without sacrificing comfort or flexibility. Finding
          lightweight, durable batteries that last long enough without needing
          frequent recharging is tricky. A playful approach could involve
          experimenting with alternative energy sources like kinetic or solar
          energy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. Sensor Integration and Accuracy:</strong><br />
          Sensors need to be embedded in the fabric without compromising its
          wearability. Ensuring these sensors accurately collect data (like
          temperature, heart rate, or movement) is difficult. A playful approach
          could involve testing different sensor placements or materials to see
          how they interact with the clothing and influence data accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Durability and Washing:</strong><br />
          Smart clothing must be durable enough to withstand regular washing and
          everyday wear. Making electronics waterproof and machine-washable is a
          challenge. This is an area where a playful approach could involve
          trial-and-error testing with different materials or protective
          coatings to find the most reliable solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. Comfort and Wearability:</strong><br />
          Adding technology to clothing may make it less comfortable, especially
          when it comes to sensors and wires. Designers need to balance
          functionality with comfort. A playful approach could be prototyping
          various designs, focusing on experimenting with different shapes,
          placements, and materials to optimize comfort while maintaining
          functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. Data Processing and User Interface:</strong><br />
          The smart clothing will generate large amounts of data, and a key
          challenge is processing it and presenting it in an understandable way
          through an app or interface. A playful approach here could include
          iterative design of the interface, testing various data
          visualizations, and allowing room for user feedback to refine the
          product.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <h3>4. Some domains and limitations of applying tinkering</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1. User Interface Design:</strong><br />
        Tinkering in UI design could allow for exploration of different layouts,
        color schemes, and interaction models to improve user engagement and
        accessibility. This could be combined with computational user interface
        development to assess different UI designs with algorithms. However,
        limitations include the potential risk of creating overly complex,
        cluttered or confusing interfaces if not iterated properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Web User Interface Development:</strong><br />
        Web UI development is a field where tinkering allows constant testing
        and refinement of responsive, dynamic elements, especially combined with
        automated CI/CD pipelines. An untinkerable domain here could involve
        ensuring security standards, which requires more structured and careful
        development than experimentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3. Requirements Defining in Software Projects:</strong><br />
        Through iterative feedback and exploring different methods of
        requirement elicitation (e.g., user stories, prototyping, workshops),
        new ways to engage stakeholders and prioritize features can be
        discovered. The limitation is that tinkering may lead to scope creep or
        confusion, especially when stakeholder goals are misaligned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4. Smart Watches:</strong><br />
        Ideas like experimenting with novel haptic feedback systems, integrating
        environmental sensors, or exploring alternative input methods (e.g.,
        skin gestures) can be tinkered with. However, limitations include
        battery life constraints and small screen sizes, which restrict how much
        data or functionality can be displayed to tinker with. The device
        dimensions, materials and other physical properties might not be as open
        to freeminded tinkering as its digital user interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>5. Virtual Reality User Interface Development:</strong><br />
        Tinkering with VR user interfaces could lead to more immersive
        experiences, using spatial gestures, eye-tracking, or neural interfaces
        that can be implemented as lo-fi prototypes first, tested and then
        possibly included if there is potential interacitonal value in them.
        Limitations come with the complexity of creating fluid, intuitive
        navigation and avoiding motion sickness.
