      <h2>Hands-on Tinkering and Tinkerability criteria</h2>
      <p>
        This post contains my findings on the tinkerability of the Makedo,
        littleBits, and Meccano tinkering materials. These materials are
        reviewed from the tinkerability viewpoints of preciousness,
        interoperability, self-guiding, level of instruction (skills, tools)
        needed, collaboratability and sensory engagement.

      <h2>Initial Reflection on Tinkering</h2>
      <p>
        This post contains some of my initial reflectioning and thoughts about
        tinkering before the course has properly kicked off.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Defining Tinkering, Trial-and-Error, and Brainstorming</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Tinkering:</strong> "To work in the manner of a tinker.
        Especially: to repair, adjust, or work with something in an unskilled or
        experimental manner." (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>) | "Engaging in hands-on
        experimentation with an object, system, or idea, often without a fixed
        goal, to explore possibilities, make adjustments, or improve
        functionality." (<em>Chat-GPT</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Trial-and-Error:</strong> "Finding out the best way to reach a
        desired result or a correct solution by trying out one or more ways or
        means and by noting and eliminating errors or causes of failure."
        (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>) | "A method of problem-solving that involves
        testing different approaches, learning from failures, and refining the
        solution through iteration." (<em>Chat-GPT</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Brainstorming:</strong> "A group problem-solving technique that
        involves the spontaneous contribution of ideas from all members of the
        group." (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>) | "A creative process where
        individuals or groups generate and refine ideas through free-flowing,
        spontaneous discussion without immediate judgment." (<em>Chat-GPT</em>)
      </p>
      <br />

      <strong
        >Definition of a 'tinkering mindset' by the course materials:</strong
      >
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is a required open-endedness (considering a solution space or
          result).
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a notion of iteration (trial and error, incremental
          improvements and changes).
        </li>
        <li>The process and mindset are active, hands-on, and experimental.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Comparison:</strong> The Merriam-Webster definitions emphasize
        the traditional and structured meanings of these concepts, while
        Chat-GPT's definitions focus on their practical and exploratory aspects.
        The course's "tinkering mindset" aligns closely with both but emphasizes
        open-ended exploration, iteration, and hands-on experimentation.
        Tinkering overlaps with trial-and-error but is more creative, and
        brainstorming shares elements of spontaneity but lacks the hands-on
        aspect of tinkering.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Technical Hurdles in an I-Tech Project</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>A typical I-Tech Related Project Case: Smart Clothing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Smart clothing combines fashion and technology, often integrating
        sensors and electronics into fabric to monitor health, track movement,
        or improve comfort.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. Power Supply and Battery Life:</strong><br />
          One of the biggest challenges in smart clothing is integrating a power
          supply without sacrificing comfort or flexibility. Finding
          lightweight, durable batteries that last long enough without needing
          frequent recharging is tricky. A playful approach could involve
          experimenting with alternative energy sources like kinetic or solar
          energy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. Sensor Integration and Accuracy:</strong><br />
          Sensors need to be embedded in the fabric without compromising its
          wearability. Ensuring these sensors accurately collect data (like
          temperature, heart rate, or movement) is difficult. A playful approach
          could involve testing different sensor placements or materials to see
          how they interact with the clothing and influence data accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Durability and Washing:</strong><br />
          Smart clothing must be durable enough to withstand regular washing and
          everyday wear. Making electronics waterproof and machine-washable is a
          challenge. This is an area where a playful approach could involve
          trial-and-error testing with different materials or protective
          coatings to find the most reliable solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. Comfort and Wearability:</strong><br />
          Adding technology to clothing may make it less comfortable, especially
          when it comes to sensors and wires. Designers need to balance
          functionality with comfort. A playful approach could be prototyping
          various designs, focusing on experimenting with different shapes,
          placements, and materials to optimize comfort while maintaining
          functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. Data Processing and User Interface:</strong><br />
          The smart clothing will generate large amounts of data, and a key
          challenge is processing it and presenting it in an understandable way
          through an app or interface. A playful approach here could include
          iterative design of the interface, testing various data
          visualizations, and allowing room for user feedback to refine the
          product.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Resources for Tinkerspiration</h3>
      <p><strong>Physical Resources:</strong></p>

      </ul>
      <h3>4. Some domains and limitations of applying tinkering</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>1. User Interface Design:</strong><br />
        Tinkering in UI design could allow for exploration of different layouts,
        color schemes, and interaction models to improve user engagement and
        accessibility. This could be combined with computational user interface
        development to assess different UI designs with algorithms. However,
        limitations include the potential risk of creating overly complex,
        cluttered or confusing interfaces if not iterated properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Web User Interface Development:</strong><br />
        Web UI development is a field where tinkering allows constant testing
        and refinement of responsive, dynamic elements, especially combined with
        automated CI/CD pipelines. An untinkerable domain here could involve
        ensuring security standards, which requires more structured and careful
        development than experimentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>3. Requirements Defining in Software Projects:</strong><br />
        Through iterative feedback and exploring different methods of
        requirement elicitation (e.g., user stories, prototyping, workshops),
        new ways to engage stakeholders and prioritize features can be
        discovered. The limitation is that tinkering may lead to scope creep or
        confusion, especially when stakeholder goals are misaligned.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>4. Smart Watches:</strong><br />
        Ideas like experimenting with novel haptic feedback systems, integrating
        environmental sensors, or exploring alternative input methods (e.g.,
        skin gestures) can be tinkered with. However, limitations include
        battery life constraints and small screen sizes, which restrict how much
        data or functionality can be displayed to tinker with. The device
        dimensions, materials and other physical properties might not be as open
        to freeminded tinkering as its digital user interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>5. Virtual Reality User Interface Development:</strong><br />
        Tinkering with VR user interfaces could lead to more immersive
        experiences, using spatial gestures, eye-tracking, or neural interfaces
        that can be implemented as lo-fi prototypes first, tested and then
        possibly included if there is potential interacitonal value in them.
        Limitations come with the complexity of creating fluid, intuitive
        navigation and avoiding motion sickness.
