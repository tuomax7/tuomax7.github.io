      <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! I am a fourth-year Computer Science student from Aalto University
        in Finland, passionate about frontend web development and Human-Computer
        Interaction. Currently, I am on a study exchange at the University of
        Twente, specializing in Interaction Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I work as a Full Stack Developer in a software
        company where I contribute to web and mobile client projects using
        mainly React and Node.js. Previously, I have also worked as a Teaching
        Assistant in programming at Aalto University.
      </p>

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy building intuitive and interesting user interfaces, focusing on
        usability and modern development practices. I am especially interested
        in design systems and utilizing generative AI in user interface design
        as a form of tinkering.
